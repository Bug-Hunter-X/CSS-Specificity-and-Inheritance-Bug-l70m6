The solution involves increasing the specificity of the `div p` selector. This can be achieved by using a more specific selector or adding an important declaration. Here's the corrected CSS code:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* !important increases specificity to override */
}
```

Alternatively, you can increase specificity by adding another parent element:

```css
.container div p {
  color: green;
}
```

Now, the `div p` rule will correctly override the `div` rule and apply the green color to the paragraph elements inside the `div`.
